* the implementation sub-directories are named with just the language. rename to start with impl- to reflect their part in the complete build.
* app-web builds and runs properly when IMPL is cpp but not the others. fix each in a separate task.
  * fix IMPL=c case
  * fix IMPL=rust case
  * fix IMPL=go case
