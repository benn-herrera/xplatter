## examples/hello-xplattergy/app-web
this example does not work.
* ```make serve``` does build all the pieces and runs the local http server
* visiting http://localhost:8080 does show the expected UI
* hitting the 'greet' button does *not* result in the greeting message showing in the web interface
* it is not clear if whether this is a failure in the API to be correctly invoked or whether it is a failure to correctly update the DOM with the unboxed response string.
