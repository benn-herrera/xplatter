# Future Work

## V2 features (or good for-pay candidates):
  * add an Android/KMP and maybe iOS/KMP binding targets
  * support exporting a typescript binding instead of javascript for web targets.

## Keep an eye on the cost/value of Go as a supported implementation language
  * decision to include it is gut level backed by some experience
    * COULD offer quick, agentic driven prototyping & discovery with higher reliability
    * with working Go impl + agentically maintained spec porting from discovery language (Go) to delivery language (Rust, C, or C++) will be cheaper than ever before.
    * COULD be an attactive nuisance
  * experiment during building of projects downstream of xplattergy
  * if it shows deal breaker issues or just doesn't pan out cut it and save the hassle.
